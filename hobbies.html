                <p> Among all of the many sports and hobbies that I have tried (and there are many), my favourite thing to do is climb. Unlike alot of people who climbed as kids I was comletely averse to the idea untill about two years ago. After overcoming some minor height related fears, I quickly became rather obsessed with it. There are many variations of climbing, with indoor and outdoor options. I mostly climb small walls without ropes which is known as 'bouldering'. However the scope for scale and increasing difficulty is never ending as you can boulder outside, use ropes to climb with preestabished bolts for attaching your rope in (sport climbing).If you are even more adventurous, 'trad climbing' involves establishing your own bolts as you climb. For those with a proclivity for being near death there is the insane arean of 'free soloing'. This was made particularly famous recently in the oscar winning documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRVZ4SW7WU"><span class="links">free solo</span></a> which shows alex honnold climb el capitan (~2300m high) with no ropes! Embedded to the left is one of my favourite climbing documentaries which shows Adam Ondra, currently one of the worlds top climbers, attempting an insanely difficult climb </p>

                <p>  I have always surfed during holidays but never went often enough to notice significant improvement. But now I have committed to improving and have bought both a surfboard and a wetsuit! I don't think people realise the quality of surf that is available in Ireland. The west coast of Ireland has something quite magical to it and the waves are a huge part of that alure. There is something for everyone from beginners to world class professionals and great surf schools throughout the country. To the left I have embedded the trailer an documentary about Irish surfing which centers around lahinch Co.Clare, showing off the beauty of the area and passion the people have there towards surfing. <br>If you are thinking of planning a surf trip anytime soon I have listed 5 great places to try (especially if you are a beginner!) </p>

                <p> One of my favorite things to do is be out in nature as much as I can. Hiking provides this opportunity. With so many great hikes to do all over the country I feel it is a great way to spend a saturday or sunday morning. You really cannot go wrong but if you are lacking inspiration, no matter where you are, you can find a nice hiking trail. <a href="https://www.irishtrails.ie/">Irish trails</a> is a great website to find trails and gives all types of categories of hikes with varying levels of difficulty and legnth. The dream is to eventually spend a winter hiking through patagonia in South America.</p>

        <p>In the age of addictive on demand boxsets and youtube I find the practice of reading both worryingly less common and increasingly difficult to find time for as my attention span is reduced by the day! That said in recent years I have made it my goal to reestablish my reading habits and thankfully I am once again an avid reader. Below are books that I have read recently that have captivated my attention and shifted my perspective making them very difficult to put down! </p>

                    <h5>Into Thin Air - Jon Krakauer</h5>
                    <p> Into thin air follows the author Jon Krakauer as he embarks on a guided expedition to the summit of mount everest in autum 199?. During the previous decades, Everest which has borders both in Tibet and Napal saw a proliferation in activity and commercialisaiton. In response to this increased apetite for adventure many seasoned climbers and alpinists created guided tour companies, which with the help of local sherpas promised the safest possible climb to the summit. Although pricey the trips attract climbers with little to no experience. Jon happens to be part of a group which attempts the summit in may 199. This year was notorious for high mortalities and the book gives an first person insight into the factors which led to the tragic death of  climbers.</p>

                    <h5>The Tatooist of Auschwitz - Heather Morris</h5>
                    <p> The Tatooist of Auschwitz is a harrowing true story of a man trying to survive in the Auschwitz concentration camp. It is the best book I have ever read on the topic and gives such a unique perspective which highlights the extreme capacity of humans for both cruelty and perserverance. Lale Sokolov manages to get a job working as the tatooist, putting the prisoner numbers onto their arms as they arrive at the camp. The story follows both before, during and after his time in the camp, and highlights the difficulty in recnciling such a past. As Alexander Solzhenitsyn famously said, "the line between good and evil runs through every man", this is a sobering truth the story highlights, with a constant blur between the black and white of morality.</p>

                    <h5>Can't Hurt Me - David Goggins</h5>
                    <p>Can't hurt me is the incredible biography by David Goggins. He can probably be desrcribed as one of the toughest men alive and the continued insight into his insane mental fortitude will have you wanting to get up at 4 am to do push ups. This book is tough love personified, David tracks back through his tough and abusive childhood at the hands of his father. He recounts his failures in school his lack of disipline and purpose. He began to develop a system of self reliance and accountability to not let any excuse get in the way of achieving what he wanted to do. David Goggins is both a former navy seal and ultra marathon runner and puts the question to the reader, 'what excuses are you making in your life? If I could do all this despite my past, why aren't you doing it?'. It is the best motivational book I have ever read.</p>
