            <p> Something about the cold has always fascinated me, intrigued by the seemingly insane swimmers who insist on braving the elements everyday I wanted to find out more. In the age of profound comfort and unprecedented luxury one can largely avoid physical hardship on a daily basis (bar obvious exceptions), yet there is a cohort of people who seek this discomfort. Originally the idea of swimming in the sea in the depths of winter seemed like a ludicrous idea, that was an area exclusive to the summer months. Yet I would regularly meet people of all ages who speak with real passion about the importance it holds in their daily routine, almost like a transcendent or meditative experience. Obviously I had to try this for myself. The ocean temperature of the Irish sea is remarkable gradual in its transitions, we are lucky that the lower range caps at around 7 degrees celsius, and warms up to 15 degrees celsius.</p>

            <p> It was January when I first started, being among the colder group of months I thought it would be a baptism of fire of sorts. I was not wrong. Luckily I had a friend participating in this endevour with me so I had no choice whether to go on a given day or not. We started off slow, going in the afternoons on a saturday. Initially I hated it, I dreaded it on the car journey up and questioned my decision until I was submerged for approximately a minute. At this point I either acclimatize or go numb from the cold and suddenly I start to actually quite enjoy it. Getting out of the water feels incredible, you feel inpenetrable to the weather, until it wears off after a few minutes and you make a dash for the warm refuge of your car. Simce then swimming in the ocean has become one my most important and enjoyable weekly routines. I found that the desire to not go does not dissappear but dampens as your body begins to trust this as a beneficial exercise as opposed to that of personal armageddon. It began to strike me more and more that there has to be something scientifially proven to be beneficial. I liken swimming in the sea to a restart button on the day, no matter the weather conditions, my mood or feelings, I feel immidately re-energised and alive once I swim, I could not recommend a more important activity. This exact sentiment was portrayed excellently in an RTE documentary called <a href="https://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/living/2019/0401/1039928-new-rte-doc-celebrates-irelands-most-enthusiastic-swimmers/"><span>Vitamin Sea</span></a>.I want to research more into the topic, do a review on the current medical literature about potential pros and cons of cold water swimming. I intend to publish this article on medium and use this page as a method of promoting my current blog interests/works. Two particularly interesting areas are in immunity (domonstrated by the Wim Hof method) and neurodegeneration </p>

        <h2> Wim Hof Method</h2>

        <div class="fullwidthtext">
            <p> The Wim hof method is a breathing technique in combination with gradual cold exposure which the creator, Wim Hof claims has powerful immune boosting effects. At first this may seem ludicrous but this man is no joke! According to his website he holds over 21 guinness world records which include running a half marathon above the artic cirle, barefoot, wearing shorts and swimming underneath ice for 66 meters. This is where he gets the name 'the Iceman'. Interestingly he was the subject of a scientific study published in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America), which showed his ability to dampen his immune system in response to an injection with a partial, inactive part of a bacteria, which would normally cause a feverish response. Even more interesting is that in this paper is that he trained other people to do the exact same thing! The video here explains the study well. </p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6jqaALpEFM" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
