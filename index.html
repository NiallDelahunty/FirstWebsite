This website was originallly for the purpose of a web app development assignment but I now use it as a personal website. The website is multi-faceted, it acts as a resume demonstrating my education background and merits, as well as professional experience, interests and projects that I have completed. The tutoring page links to a booking system for one to one or group grinds in a variety of subjects. The hobbies and galleries pages will more reflect what I like to do with my free time and a visual representation of that.  </p>

                <h3> BSc Biomedical Health and Life Science (BHLS) - UCD/Lund University</h3> <p> Following a long held fascination with biology, I pursued this course to gain a better understanding of disease, its molecular mechanisms, current treatments and the tools being used to research new more effective ailments and improvements in outcomes. BHLS provided a strong foundation in basic science spanning the areas of pharmacology, genetics, biochemistry and physiology. However its focus was on translational research, in essence how to bring new scientific findings into a clinically relevant context (i.e. bench to bedside). During this time I was fortunate enough to gain experience both in UCD and in two universities in sweden (Lund University and Karolinska Institute) in exciting areas including infectious medicine and cancer biology.</p>

            <h3> Research MSc Molecular Biology - UCD </h3>
            <p> Having gained some experience in my udergraduate degree I was interested in deep diving further into the world of biological research. I have always found the molecular mechansims underpinning cellular activity to be particularly interesting and so when an opportunity came to undertake a year of research in this area I jumped at the opportunity! In my research I was attempting to elucidate a potential molecular mechanism underpinning an apparent link between hypercapnia (high blood carbon dioxide) and immune suppression. Specifically I was investigating changes in ubiquitylation chains in key regulatory NF-kB proteins. </p>

            <h3> Higher Diploma in Computing </h3>
            <p> Given the complexity of biological systems and the vast amount of data an experiment can yield, more advanced computational aids and methods have quickly become powerful tools for gaining new biological insights. Having a shallow exposure, I began to appreciate the power of programming and really enjoyed the idea of conceptualising something and then having the practical skills to create it. However I was not sure if I preferred more building things (software engineering) or making sense of data (analytics). This course provided me the opportunity to further explore these interests while gaining a strong foundation in computer science. Although not the quickest route I felt this was the best way to set up a strong foundation. </p>

            <p>I worked as part of the specimen reception team in a laboratory accredited by both the Irish National Accrediation Board (INAB) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Collectively our primary responsibility was to unpackage, organize, and prepare over 1000 daily incoming patient samples for diagnostic testing and analysis for infectious diseases ranging from HIV and Hepatitus to influenza and mumps arriving as a multitude of different sample types</p>

I worked on an independent project investigating differential ubiquitination of the NF-kB pathway as a potential underlying mechanism. As a result of this body of work I was awarded a research MSc.</p>

            <p>My academic interests overall are learning how computational methods can be used to solve biological problems. I would like to gain insights into different specific fields and understand the landscape better. At the moment I’m sure I’m not alone in thinking AI applications to biological data or for drug discovery/design is a particularly interesting prospect. My academic interest is in solving biological questions and finding solutions to health related problems. In the era of profound technology growth I have noticed how quickly submerged we become in vast amount of data. I see the ability to be able to handle, manipulate and interpret large data sets is quickly becoming an essential skill.
